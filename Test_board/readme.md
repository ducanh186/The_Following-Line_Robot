# Test Board - Test Cases

This folder contains test cases for the following functionalities:

1. **PWM and Motor Test**
      - Verify the operation of PWM signals and ensure the motor responds correctly.

2. **ADC Value Test from LDR to ESP32**
      - Check the ADC readings from the Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor to the ESP32 microcontroller.

3. **Threshold Value Detection**
      - Determine the upper and lower threshold values based on the ADC readings.

4. **Threshold Verification**
      - Test and validate the thresholds obtained to ensure correct system behavior.

Each test case includes detailed steps and expected results to facilitate hardware and firmware validation.
